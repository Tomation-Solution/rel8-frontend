/**
 * The rail, in the order every mockup draws it. See REDESIGN.md §4.
 *
 * `Chat` is deliberately absent. The mockups draw a standalone Chat page, but chat is a
 * property of an Environment on this backend (`Environment.hasChat`, and a socket protocol
 * keyed on `environmentId`), so it lives inside the Environment detail page instead of as
 * a second, parallel place to have the same conversations. Decided with the user, M13.
 *
 * Two rules worth keeping:
 *  - every entry gets a distinct icon (the pre-redesign rail reused FiUser four times);
 *  - `key` is what Sidebar.tsx looks up to hang a count badge or unread dot on an item,
 *    so renaming an entry does not silently drop its badge.
