/**
 * Removed: `verifyUserMembership` and `createMember`.
 *
 * They posted to `/auth/ManageMemberValidation/` and
 * `/auth/ManageMemberValidation/create_member/` — Django-era paths this backend does not
 * mount — and they implemented a self-registration flow that **does not exist**. Members
 * are created by an admin (or by an approved application); they receive an email, set a
 * password and log in. There is nothing to register for.
 *
 * The two screens that drove it, `VerifyMemberPage` and `RegistrationPage`, are gone with
 * them.
 */

/*
 * Removed: `resetPassword`.
 *
 * `POST /members/reset-password/:token` exists on the backend but nothing here called it.
 * The portal sets passwords through `setPassword` (`POST /members/set-password`), which is
 * where the forgot-password email now points and which also marks the member verified —
 * `reset-password` does neither. One path, not two.
